By contrast,&#xD;&#xA;the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to&#xD;&#xA;share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free&#xD;&#xA;software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the&#xD;&#xA;GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to&#xD;&#xA;any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to&#xD;&#xA;your programs, too.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not&#xD;&#xA;price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you&#xD;&#xA;have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for&#xD;&#xA;them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you&#xD;&#xA;want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new&#xD;&#xA;free programs, and that you know you can do these things.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you&#xD;&#xA;these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have&#xD;&#xA;certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if&#xD;&#xA;you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether&#xD;&#xA;gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same&#xD;&#xA;freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive&#xD;&#xA;or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they&#xD;&#xA;know their rights.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:&#xD;&#xA;(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License&#xD;&#xA;giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains&#xD;&#xA;that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and&#xD;&#xA;authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as&#xD;&#xA;changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to&#xD;&#xA;authors of previous versions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run&#xD;&#xA;modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer&#xD;&#xA;can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of&#xD;&#xA;protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic&#xD;&#xA;pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to&#xD;&#xA;use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we&#xD;&#xA;have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those&#xD;&#xA;products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we&#xD;&#xA;stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions&#xD;&#xA;of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.&#xD;&#xA;States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of&#xD;&#xA;software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to&#xD;&#xA;avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could&#xD;&#xA;make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that&#xD;&#xA;patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and&#xD;&#xA;modification follow.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  0. Definitions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  &quot;This License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  &quot;Copyright&quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of&#xD;&#xA;works, such as semiconductor masks.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  &quot;The Program&quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this&#xD;&#xA;License.  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.  &quot;Licensees&quot; and&#xD;&#xA;&quot;recipients&quot; may be individuals or organizations.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  To &quot;modify&quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work&#xD;&#xA;in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an&#xD;&#xA;exact copy.  The resulting work is called a &quot;modified version&quot; of the&#xD;&#xA;earlier work or a work &quot;based on&quot; the earlier work.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  A &quot;covered work&quot; means either the unmodified Program or a work based&#xD;&#xA;on the Program.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  To &quot;propagate&quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without&#xD;&#xA;permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for&#xD;&#xA;infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a&#xD;&#xA;computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,&#xD;&#xA;distribution (with or without modification), making available to the&#xD;&#xA;public, and in some countries other activities as well.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  To &quot;convey&quot; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other&#xD;&#xA;parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through&#xD;&#xA;a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  An interactive user interface displays &quot;Appropriate Legal Notices&quot;&#xD;&#xA;to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible&#xD;&#xA;feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)&#xD;&#xA;tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the&#xD;&#xA;extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the&#xD;&#xA;work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If&#xD;&#xA;the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a&#xD;&#xA;menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  1. Source Code.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  The &quot;source code&quot; for a work means the preferred form of the work&#xD;&#xA;for making modifications to it.  &quot;Object code&quot; means any non-source&#xD;&#xA;form of a work.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  A &quot;Standard Interface&quot; means an interface that either is an official&#xD;&#xA;standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of&#xD;&#xA;interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that&#xD;&#xA;is widely used among developers working in that language.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  The &quot;System Libraries&quot; of an executable work include anything, other&#xD;&#xA;than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of&#xD;&#xA;packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major&#xD;&#xA;Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that&#xD;&#xA;Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an&#xD;&#xA;implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A&#xD;&#xA;&quot;Major Component&quot;, in this context, means a major essential component&#xD;&#xA;(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system&#xD;&#xA;(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to&#xD;&#xA;produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  The &quot;Corresponding Source&quot; for a work in object code form means all&#xD;&#xA;the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable&#xD;&#xA;work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to&#xD;&#xA;control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's&#xD;&#xA;System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free&#xD;&#xA;programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but&#xD;&#xA;which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source&#xD;&#xA;includes interface definition files associated with source files for&#xD;&#xA;the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically&#xD;&#xA;linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,&#xD;&#xA;such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those&#xD;&#xA;subprograms and other parts of the work.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users&#xD;&#xA;can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding&#xD;&#xA;Source.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that&#xD;&#xA;same work.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  2. Basic Permissions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of&#xD;&#xA;copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated&#xD;&#xA;conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited&#xD;&#xA;permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a&#xD;&#xA;covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its&#xD;&#xA;content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your&#xD;&#xA;rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not&#xD;&#xA;convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains&#xD;&#xA;in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose&#xD;&#xA;of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you&#xD;&#xA;with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with&#xD;&#xA;the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do&#xD;&#xA;not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works&#xD;&#xA;for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction&#xD;&#xA;and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of&#xD;&#xA;your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under&#xD;&#xA;the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10&#xD;&#xA;makes it unnecessary.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological&#xD;&#xA;measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article&#xD;&#xA;11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or&#xD;&#xA;similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such&#xD;&#xA;measures.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid&#xD;&#xA;circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention&#xD;&#xA;is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to&#xD;&#xA;the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or&#xD;&#xA;modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's&#xD;&#xA;users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of&#xD;&#xA;technological measures.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you&#xD;&#xA;receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and&#xD;&#xA;appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;&#xD;&#xA;keep intact all notices stating that this License and any&#xD;&#xA;non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;&#xD;&#xA;keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all&#xD;&#xA;recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,&#xD;&#xA;and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to&#xD;&#xA;produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the&#xD;&#xA;terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified&#xD;&#xA;    it, and giving a relevant date.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is&#xD;&#xA;    released under this License and any conditions added under section&#xD;&#xA;    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to&#xD;&#xA;    &quot;keep intact all notices&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this&#xD;&#xA;    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This&#xD;&#xA;    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7&#xD;&#xA;    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,&#xD;&#xA;    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no&#xD;&#xA;    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not&#xD;&#xA;    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display&#xD;&#xA;    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive&#xD;&#xA;    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your&#xD;&#xA;    work need not make them do so.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent&#xD;&#xA;works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,&#xD;&#xA;and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,&#xD;&#xA;in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an&#xD;&#xA;&quot;aggregate&quot; if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not&#xD;&#xA;used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users&#xD;&#xA;beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work&#xD;&#xA;in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other&#xD;&#xA;parts of the aggregate.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms&#xD;&#xA;of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the&#xD;&#xA;machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,&#xD;&#xA;in one of these ways:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product&#xD;&#xA;    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the&#xD;&#xA;    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium&#xD;&#xA;    customarily used for software interchange.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product&#xD;&#xA;    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a&#xD;&#xA;    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as&#xD;&#xA;    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product&#xD;&#xA;    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a&#xD;&#xA;    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the&#xD;&#xA;    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical&#xD;&#xA;    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no&#xD;&#xA;    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this&#xD;&#xA;    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the&#xD;&#xA;    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the&#xD;&#xA;    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This&#xD;&#xA;    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and&#xD;&#xA;    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord&#xD;&#xA;    with subsection 6b.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated&#xD;&#xA;    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the&#xD;&#xA;    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no&#xD;&#xA;    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the&#xD;&#xA;    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to&#xD;&#xA;    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source&#xD;&#xA;    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)&#xD;&#xA;    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain&#xD;&#xA;    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the&#xD;&#xA;    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the&#xD;&#xA;    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is&#xD;&#xA;    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided&#xD;&#xA;    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding&#xD;&#xA;    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no&#xD;&#xA;    charge under subsection 6d.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded&#xD;&#xA;from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be&#xD;&#xA;included in conveying the object code work.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  A &quot;User Product&quot; is either (1) a &quot;consumer product&quot;, which means any&#xD;&#xA;tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,&#xD;&#xA;or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation&#xD;&#xA;into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,&#xD;&#xA;doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular&#xD;&#xA;product received by a particular user, &quot;normally used&quot; refers to a&#xD;&#xA;typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status&#xD;&#xA;of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user&#xD;&#xA;actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product&#xD;&#xA;is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial&#xD;&#xA;commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent&#xD;&#xA;the only significant mode of use of the product.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  &quot;Installation Information&quot; for a User Product means any methods,&#xD;&#xA;procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install&#xD;&#xA;and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from&#xD;&#xA;a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must&#xD;&#xA;suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object&#xD;&#xA;code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because&#xD;&#xA;modification has been made.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or&#xD;&#xA;specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as&#xD;&#xA;part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the&#xD;&#xA;User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a&#xD;&#xA;fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the&#xD;&#xA;Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied&#xD;&#xA;by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply&#xD;&#xA;if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install&#xD;&#xA;modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has&#xD;&#xA;been installed in ROM).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a&#xD;&#xA;requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates&#xD;&#xA;for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for&#xD;&#xA;the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a&#xD;&#xA;network may be denied when the modification itself materially and&#xD;&#xA;adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and&#xD;&#xA;protocols for communication across the network.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,&#xD;&#xA;in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly&#xD;&#xA;documented (and with an implementation available to the public in&#xD;&#xA;source code form), and must require no special password or key for&#xD;&#xA;unpacking, reading or copying.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  7. Additional Terms.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  &quot;Additional permissions&quot; are terms that supplement the terms of this&#xD;&#xA;License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.&#xD;&#xA;Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall&#xD;&#xA;be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent&#xD;&#xA;that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions&#xD;&#xA;apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately&#xD;&#xA;under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by&#xD;&#xA;this License without regard to the additional permissions.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option&#xD;&#xA;remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of&#xD;&#xA;it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own&#xD;&#xA;removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place&#xD;&#xA;additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,&#xD;&#xA;for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you&#xD;&#xA;add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of&#xD;&#xA;that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the&#xD;&#xA;    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or&#xD;&#xA;    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal&#xD;&#xA;    Notices displayed by works containing it; or&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or&#xD;&#xA;    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in&#xD;&#xA;    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or&#xD;&#xA;    authors of the material; or&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some&#xD;&#xA;    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that&#xD;&#xA;    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of&#xD;&#xA;    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for&#xD;&#xA;    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on&#xD;&#xA;    those licensors and authors.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &quot;further&#xD;&#xA;restrictions&quot; within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you&#xD;&#xA;received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is&#xD;&#xA;governed by this License along with a term that is a further&#xD;&#xA;restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains&#xD;&#xA;a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this&#xD;&#xA;License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms&#xD;&#xA;of that license document, provided that the further restriction does&#xD;&#xA;not survive such relicensing or conveying.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you&#xD;&#xA;must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the&#xD;&#xA;additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating&#xD;&#xA;where to find the applicable terms.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the&#xD;&#xA;form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;&#xD;&#xA;the above requirements apply either way.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  8. Termination.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly&#xD;&#xA;provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or&#xD;&#xA;modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under&#xD;&#xA;this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third&#xD;&#xA;paragraph of section 11).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your&#xD;&#xA;license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)&#xD;&#xA;provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and&#xD;&#xA;finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright&#xD;&#xA;holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means&#xD;&#xA;prior to 60 days after the cessation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is&#xD;&#xA;reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the&#xD;&#xA;violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have&#xD;&#xA;received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that&#xD;&#xA;copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after&#xD;&#xA;your receipt of the notice.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the&#xD;&#xA;licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under&#xD;&#xA;this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently&#xD;&#xA;reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same&#xD;&#xA;material under section 10.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or&#xD;&#xA;run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work&#xD;&#xA;occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission&#xD;&#xA;to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,&#xD;&#xA;nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or&#xD;&#xA;modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do&#xD;&#xA;not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a&#xD;&#xA;covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically&#xD;&#xA;receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and&#xD;&#xA;propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible&#xD;&#xA;for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  An &quot;entity transaction&quot; is a transaction transferring control of an&#xD;&#xA;organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an&#xD;&#xA;organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered&#xD;&#xA;work results from an entity transaction, each party to that&#xD;&#xA;transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever&#xD;&#xA;licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could&#xD;&#xA;give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the&#xD;&#xA;Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if&#xD;&#xA;the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the&#xD;&#xA;rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may&#xD;&#xA;not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of&#xD;&#xA;rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation&#xD;&#xA;(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that&#xD;&#xA;any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for&#xD;&#xA;sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  11. Patents.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  A &quot;contributor&quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this&#xD;&#xA;License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The&#xD;&#xA;work thus licensed is called the contributor's &quot;contributor version&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  A contributor's &quot;essential patent claims&quot; are all patent claims&#xD;&#xA;owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or&#xD;&#xA;hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted&#xD;&#xA;by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,&#xD;&#xA;but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a&#xD;&#xA;consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For&#xD;&#xA;purposes of this definition, &quot;control&quot; includes the right to grant&#xD;&#xA;patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of&#xD;&#xA;this License.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free&#xD;&#xA;patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to&#xD;&#xA;make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and&#xD;&#xA;propagate the contents of its contributor version.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  In the following three paragraphs, a &quot;patent license&quot; is any express&#xD;&#xA;agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent&#xD;&#xA;(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to&#xD;&#xA;sue for patent infringement).  To &quot;grant&quot; such a patent license to a&#xD;&#xA;party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a&#xD;&#xA;patent against the party.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,&#xD;&#xA;and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone&#xD;&#xA;to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a&#xD;&#xA;publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,&#xD;&#xA;then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so&#xD;&#xA;available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the&#xD;&#xA;patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner&#xD;&#xA;consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent&#xD;&#xA;license to downstream recipients.  &quot;Knowingly relying&quot; means you have&#xD;&#xA;actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the&#xD;&#xA;covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work&#xD;&#xA;in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that&#xD;&#xA;country that you have reason to believe are valid.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or&#xD;&#xA;arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a&#xD;&#xA;covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties&#xD;&#xA;receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify&#xD;&#xA;or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license&#xD;&#xA;you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered&#xD;&#xA;work and works based on it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  A patent license is &quot;discriminatory&quot; if it does not include within&#xD;&#xA;the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is&#xD;&#xA;conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are&#xD;&#xA;specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered&#xD;&#xA;work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is&#xD;&#xA;in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment&#xD;&#xA;to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying&#xD;&#xA;the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the&#xD;&#xA;parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory&#xD;&#xA;patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work&#xD;&#xA;conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily&#xD;&#xA;for and in connection with specific products or compilations that&#xD;&#xA;contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,&#xD;&#xA;or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting&#xD;&#xA;any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may&#xD;&#xA;otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or&#xD;&#xA;otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not&#xD;&#xA;excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a&#xD;&#xA;covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this&#xD;&#xA;License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may&#xD;&#xA;not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you&#xD;&#xA;to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey&#xD;&#xA;the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this&#xD;&#xA;License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have&#xD;&#xA;permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed&#xD;&#xA;under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single&#xD;&#xA;combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this&#xD;&#xA;License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,&#xD;&#xA;but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,&#xD;&#xA;section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the&#xD;&#xA;combination as such.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  14. Revised Versions of this License.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of&#xD;&#xA;the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will&#xD;&#xA;be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to&#xD;&#xA;address new problems or concerns.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the&#xD;&#xA;Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General&#xD;&#xA;Public License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the&#xD;&#xA;option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered&#xD;&#xA;version or of any later version published by the Free Software&#xD;&#xA;Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the&#xD;&#xA;GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published&#xD;&#xA;by the Free Software Foundation.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future&#xD;&#xA;versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's&#xD;&#xA;public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you&#xD;&#xA;to choose that version for the Program.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  Later license versions may give you additional or different&#xD;&#xA;permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any&#xD;&#xA;author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a&#xD;&#xA;later version.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY&#xD;&#xA;APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT&#xD;&#xA;HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY&#xD;&#xA;OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,&#xD;&#xA;THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR&#xD;&#xA;PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM&#xD;&#xA;IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF&#xD;&#xA;ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  16. Limitation of Liability.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING&#xD;&#xA;WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS&#xD;&#xA;THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY&#xD;&#xA;GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE&#xD;&#xA;USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF&#xD;&#xA;DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD&#xD;&#xA;PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),&#xD;&#xA;EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF&#xD;&#xA;SUCH DAMAGES.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided&#xD;&#xA;above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,&#xD;&#xA;reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates&#xD;&#xA;an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the&#xD;&#xA;Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a&#xD;&#xA;copy of the Program in return for a fee.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest&#xD;&#xA;possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it&#xD;&#xA;free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest&#xD;&#xA;to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively&#xD;&#xA;state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least&#xD;&#xA;the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify&#xD;&#xA;    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by&#xD;&#xA;    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or&#xD;&#xA;    (at your option) any later version.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,&#xD;&#xA;    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of&#xD;&#xA;    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

If not, see &lt;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short&#xD;&#xA;notice like this when it starts in an interactive mode:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;    &lt;program&gt;  Copyright (C) &lt;year&gt;  &lt;name of author&gt;&#xD;&#xA;    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.&#xD;&#xA;    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it&#xD;&#xA;    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate&#xD;&#xA;parts of the General Public License.  Of course, your program's commands&#xD;&#xA;might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an &quot;about box&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,&#xD;&#xA;if any, to sign a &quot;copyright disclaimer&quot; for the program, if necessary.&#xD;&#xA;For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see&#xD;&#xA;&lt;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program&#xD;&#xA;into proprietary programs.
